# 🌊 Sonar Rock vs Mine Detector

A machine learning project that classifies sonar signals to detect whether the object is a **rock** or a **mine** using the **Sonar dataset** from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

> This project demonstrates the end-to-end ML pipeline — including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment with a web interface.

🧠 Model Training
To retrain the model:

Open sonar_train.ipynb in Jupyter or Colab.

Load and preprocess the dataset.

Train using Logistic Regression / RandomForest.

Save the model:

```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'sonar_model.pkl')
```
